The goal is to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model, especially in algorithms like SVM or k-nearest neighbors where distance calculations matter.\",\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"Feature scaling is commonly used in data preprocessing to ensure that features are on the same scale. This is particularly important for gradient descent-based algorithms where features with larger scales could disproportionately impact the cost function.\",\n",
